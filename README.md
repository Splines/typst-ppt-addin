# 🚀 typst-powerpoint

Typst PowerPoint brings the power of [Typst](https://typst.app) to PowerPoint. Easily insert formulas with live preview, update them, and even generate from a file.

<sub>Maybe we can even integrate packages from the [Typst Universe](https://typst.app/universe/) in the future, vote for [this issue](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/typst.ts/issues/825) or provide a PR if you have a solution in mind ;)</sub>

### ✨ How it works & Developing

See the [Dev Guide](DEV.md) (that is currently outdated).

### 🎈 About

The first proof-of-concept came from Johannes Berger [here](https://github.com/johannesber/typst-ppt-addin) in January 2026. I forked the repo and have since been building on it, replacing the custom engine by [`typst.ts`](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/typst.ts), migrating TypeScript, improving on code quality, as well as polishing and adding a lot more functionality. If you have any feature requests or want to report a bug, head over to the [issues](https://github.com/Splines/typst-powerpoint/issues).
