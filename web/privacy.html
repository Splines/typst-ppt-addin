    <h1>Privacy Policy for Typst for PowerPoint</h1>

    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 25, 2026</p>

    <p><i>Typst for PowerPoint</i> is a PowerPoint Add-in that allows users to create and insert equations using the <a href="https://typst.app">Typst</a> typesetting system directly within PowerPoint presentations. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Typst project, but instead a community-driven effort to bring Typst's capabilities to PowerPoint users.</p>

    <p>
      The app is completely <a href="https://github.com/splines/typst-powerpoint">open source</a> and MIT-licensed. We don't store any user data or personal information. Typst code and generated content stay local on your machine within your PowerPoint files. The only data that may be collected are standard web server access logs by GitHub Pages when loading the Add-in UI, which is hosted as a static site on GitHub Pages.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <i>Typst for PowerPoint</i> ("the app", "our service", "we", or "us") handles information when you use our PowerPoint Add-in.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Typst for PowerPoint Add-in operates entirely on your local machine (except for loading the UI at startup from a static web page containing HTML/JS/CSS). When you use the app to insert equations into your PowerPoint presentations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All Typst code you write stays local on your device.</li>
      <li>All generated images and content remain within your PowerPoint document.</li>
      <li>No data is sent to our servers (we don't have any backend servers).</li>
      <li>No analytics or tracking mechanisms are implemented in the app.</li>
      <li>No user accounts are created or maintained.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Typst for PowerPoint Add-in interface is hosted as a static website on GitHub Pages. When you load the Add-in within PowerPoint, GitHub Pages may collect standard web server access logs, which could include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>Browser type and version (of the WebView inside PowerPoint)</li>
      <li>Date and time of access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These logs are collected and managed by GitHub, not by us. Please refer to
      <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a>
      for information on how GitHub handles this data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect or store any personal information, there is no user data that could be compromised. All content you create using the app remains within your PowerPoint files. There is no personal information for you to access, correct, or delete.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
