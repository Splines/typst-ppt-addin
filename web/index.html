    <p>
      <i>PPTypst</i> is a PowerPoint Add-in that allows users to insert and edit equations using the <a href="https://typst.app">Typst</a> typesetting system directly within PowerPoint presentations. It has a real-time preview of the formula and you can even generate from a file. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Typst, but instead a community-driven effort to bring Typst's capabilities to PowerPoint users.
