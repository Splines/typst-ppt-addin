    <h1>PPTypst | Typst for PowerPoint</h1>
    <p>
      Use Typst to easily insert beautiful equations into your
      PowerPoint presentations. See the project on
      <a href="https://github.com/splines/pptypst">GitHub</a>.
      Right not it is in early preview, the Add-in is not yet available on the
      PowerPoint Office Add-in Marketplace.

    <p>
      The PowerPoint Add-in will connect to this static page in order to display
      the Add-in UI. All data stays local to your machine. In fact, there is no
      backend at all as this static site is hosted on GitHub Pages.
